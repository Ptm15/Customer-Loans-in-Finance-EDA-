# Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in Finance

## Project Description
This EDA aims to analyse a company's loan portfolio data to make informed decisions regarding loans, pricing strategies, and risk management. Through data cleaning, descriptive stats, visualisation and correlation analysis, the project seeks to uncover patterns, assess risk, and evaluate loan performance based on historical data provided in the dataset.

## Importance
- Improve decision making for loan approvals
- Identify and manage risks associated with loans

## Data
Data is from a RDS, from a table called 'loan_payments' which includes all the necessary data that is needed to complete the EDA.

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies within the dataset.
- Descriptive Statistics: Understand the data set.
- Visualisations: Represent trends and relationships visually.
- Correlation Analysis: Determine impacts of loan characteristics.
- Insights 

## Goals
- Uncover patterns
- Assess risk
- Evaluate loan performance based on historical data.

## Approach
Jupyter Notebooks with analysis code and explanations will be provided along with visual representations summarising the findings.

## Impact
- Informed loan approval decisions
- Enhanced risk management
- Improved profitability through optimized loan pricing

## Conclusion
This project has provided insights for the loan portfolio which allows for more informed decision-making and improved strategies.

## Future Work
Possible future enhancements include incorporating machine learning models for further predictive analysis and further exploration of specific customer segments.
